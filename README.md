# R Fundamentals Script

This R script performs various operations on a dataset, vector, matrix, list, array, and factor.

## Dataset Operations

The script creates a dataset with two columns: name and value. It then calculates the average, median, variance, and standard deviation of the value column. It adds these calculated values as new columns to the dataset and prints the dataset after each operation.

## Vector Operations

The script creates a vector and calculates the sum of its elements. It then prints the sum and the type of the vector.

## Matrix Operations

The script creates a matrix and performs column-binding and row-binding operations. It prints the matrix after each operation.

## List Operations

The script creates a list and performs various operations such as calculating the length, appending an element, removing an element, and reversing the list. It prints the list after each operation.

## Array Operations

The script creates an array and checks if an item exists in the array. It also iterates over the array and prints each element.

## Factor Operations

The script creates a factor and performs various operations such as printing the levels, length, and the first element of the factor.

## Running the Script

To run this script, you need to have R installed on your machine. You can run the script in an R environment like RStudio. Simply copy the script into an R file and run the file in your R environment.
